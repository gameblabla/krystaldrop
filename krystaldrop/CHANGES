Changes from 0.6 to 0.7:
- added sounds for two characters (Polita and Wind)
- added a screen configuration screen
- rewritten a big chunk of the core engine (UI, sound) as a library,
  including a better ressource manager
- now uses XML resources and configuration files
- some minor bug squished (including the erratically incorrect keymapping)
