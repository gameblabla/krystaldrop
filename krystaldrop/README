Krystal Drop, v 0.7.2
A puzzle/action game, for 1/2 players

http://krystaldrop.sourceforge.net

Krystal Drop is a GPL-clone of NeoGeo's 'Magical Drop'.


Goal:
____

The game have 2 differents mode: Survival and Challenge mode.

In both modes, you play in a field where gems are being dropped from the top
at a regular basis. You could control a small character at the bottom of the
screen who can take or drop gems. You can take several gems at once, or from
different rows as long as the colors match.
Drop the gems to create a vertical alignment of at least three gems. The gems
will then burst, as well as the neighbouring gems which share the same colour.
The gems burst during a fraction of second. The whole idea is to prepare
another vertical alignment to create chain reactions. You lose when a gem reach
the bottom of the screen.

- Survival mode
You must reach the level 15 without losing. Try to earn the maximum points as
possible by creating chain reactions.

- Challenge mode
Here you challenge another player or the computer (computer AI has yet to be
implemented). When you create chain reactions, you will send some lines of
gems to your opponent, depending on how many chain reactions you can produce.

for *NIXes and Windows.
The configuration files handles the following settings:
